A person called me saying he had to pay some money to my husband and wanted to do it through gpay. He also said my husband had given my number to him for the same. He said the amount was 15000 and he will be sending 10000 first and then after that amount goes through, he will send the remaining 5000. After a minute or so he told me he had sent the amount and asked me to check for the sms from the bank. The sms I received was very similar to the actual messages from the bank. Then he said he is sending the remaining Rs5000. In the sms I received after that the message was that an amount of 50000 has been deposited. Then he told me that he had typed an additional zero by mistake and to kindly return the Rs45000. But I got suspicious of this person and checked my gpay to see if I had got the initial 10000 and the next 50000. But I had received neither. So I told the person that I will send him the money only after I check my bank account. He got angry at that and started scolding me. But I was adamant that I will send him the money after I check my bank account and talking with my husband. He then cut the call and then his phone was switched off. Thankfully his scam failed and I wasn't fooled. "
